LITERATURE SURVEY 
V Before discussing whether artificial intelligence (hereafter referred to as AI) can create art, it seems necessary to clear up confusion regarding the 
meaning of artificial intelligence. For many people, the term "artificial intelligence" conjures up images from science fiction novels: from the destructive 
robot in the "Terminator" series to the nearly omnipotent evil program in "2001: A Space Odyssey" Hal. . In this film (2013), in which the assistant 
artificial intelligence grows clever and eventually takes it beyond the physical world, the artificial intelligence is often depicted as powerful and somewhat 
overbearing, thus creating a collective image that is far from reality. The state of science is not science but fiction. The solution to this disconnect seems 
simple: Consult the scientists! As a professional talent developer, you need to know what your field involves. Unfortunately, it turns out that the scientific 
community is as divided as the public when it comes to intelligence. For some, chatbots are already artificial intelligence, while for others only deep 
learning is really necessary and even machine learning or experts are not included in this popular list. How can we have conflict? First, the difficulty of 
defining intelligence stems primarily from the difficulty of defining intelligence (e.g., the human brain), whose ability and complexity we are only 
beginning to understand. Add to this the fact that artificial intelligence is a very technological discipline and that every innovation leads to scepticism, 
criticism and failure, and add the fact that some of the best hearts in the world have studied the subject for more than a century. Artificial intelligence. 
Causing a crisis. However, several movements can be identified in this rivalry; movements that revolve around two main opponents: symbolism and 
connection.
III. SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT 
4.1 WORKING
The AI Art Generator is a system designed to create unique and aesthetically pleasing artworks using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques.
he system employs a generative model, likely based on a deep neural network, to learn patterns and styles from a given dataset. The working involves 
the following steps:
• Input Image Analysis: The system analyzes input images to understand patterns, colors, and styles.
